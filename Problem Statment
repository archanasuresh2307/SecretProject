Problem statement:
Given a rubik's cube, capture the 6 faces in sequence and present steps for solving the cube.

Needed: 
Image processing: 
  To capture image from camera
  To distinguish object form background
  To distinguish each tiny-cube on a given face
  To distinguish colour

Solution Processing:
  Get the program to read the information and store it.
  Get the program to solve it and provide stpes
  
  Ambitious: Use AWS to solve the problem
  
Integration:
  Feed data form the image processing library to the library that solves it.

Identify programs to use:
Image processing can be done using Matlab, Java, C, C++
Solution Processing can be done using Java, C, C++

we can breakdown the components and work on each.
Let's start with the Solution Processing.

Identify algorithm.

Step 1: Check out notations: How to identify face and how to identify movements:
